To start running locally:

- Install node 20 to match the deployment environment. Anything over 16 should work though.
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start dev server

To deploy:

- `npm run build` to build the dist folder
- use vscode azure extension to deploy the `wcbt-ai` app service
